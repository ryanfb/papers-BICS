My main reaction, as a non-specialist, was that it was a very technical paper,
with a lot of detail on the database and XML implementation, and not very
accessible for someone wanting to understand how these resources advance
scholarship. The authors name the 3 resources in the first paragraph, without
saying what is in them and dismiss the use case in a sweeping "The benefits of
unifying these data sources should be obvious..". I would have liked to learn
more about how the resources are interrogated online and how they are used,
and by whom. Maybe this is unfair if readers will already be familiar with
them, but I am not.
