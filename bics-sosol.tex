\section*{Introduction}

Integrating Digital Papyrology (IDP) is a joint project among a number of institutions aimed at improving and combining the relationships between three digital papyrological resources: the Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri (DDbDP), the Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen Papyrusurkunden \"{A}gyptens (HGV), and the Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS). Started in 1983, the DDbDP digitally collects a number of transcriptions of ancient documentary papyri from print editions. HGV and APIS, meanwhile, collect metadata (findspots, dates, etc.) and images of much of the same material. The benefits of unifying these data sources should be obvious, and in 2007 the Scholarly Communications Division of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded a project, “Integrating Digital Papyrology,” to do just that. Over the years the DDbDP has undergone a number of transitions, and this project also supported its transition from idiosyncratic SGML to standards-based EpiDoc XML. In addition the grant provided funding to improve and finish the first generation of a tool for searching and browsing the unified collection of materials, called the Papyrological Navigator (or PN). At the conclusion of the IDP grant, Mellon funded a second phase of the project (called IDP2) with the following goals\footnote{\url{http://idp.atlantides.org/trac/idp/wiki/BackgroundAndFunding}}:
\begin{quote}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Improve operability of the PN search interface on the merged and mapped data from the DDbDP, HGV, and APIS.
    \item Facilitate third-party use of the data and tools.
    \item Create a version controlled, transparent and fully audited, multi-author, web-based, real-time, tagless, editing environment, which — in tandem with a new editorial infrastructure — will allow the entire community of papyrologists to take control of the process of populating these communal assets with data.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{quote}The environment described in the last item, inspired by the Suda On-Line\footnote{The Suda On-Line (\url{http://www.stoa.org/sol/}) is a project aimed at collaborative translation of the massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia known as the \emph{Suda}.}, came to be known as the \emph{Son} of Suda On-Line (SoSOL).\citep{background, sosin, babeu}
